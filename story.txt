	It all began with a woman named Diane. Each day, she wore perfume with
the scent of daffodils, and the smell of the flowers trailed behind her
where ever she went. One day, on her commute to work, she came across a
peculiar florist's shop that she had never seen before. Upon entering, she found
that the florist sold only roses and tulips. Her presence, or rather, the
presence of her perfume, made the roses and tulips very cross (although Diana
was American, the flowers were imported from Britain).
The flowers were racist, or as racist as flowers can be. But luckily, flowers are inanimate so they weren't really able to do much to Diane except send bad vibes. On the other hand, the florist is animate. But luckily, the florist wasn't as cross about Diane's perfume as his flowers.

Suddenly, another woman, also named Diane, came in. The original Diane was unaware of the primal rage of the flowers. The new
Diane was deeply aware of the emotions of all plant, and knowing this, she was mad at our original Diane by extension.
She swung at Diane and they got into a fight.
