	It all began with a woman named Diane. Each day, she wore perfume with
the scent of daffodils, and the smell of the flowers trailed behind her
where ever she went. One day, on her commute to work, she came across a
peculiar florist's shop that she had never seen before. Upon entering, she found
that the florist sold only roses and tulips. Her presence, or rather, the
presence of her perfume, made the roses and tulips very cross (although Diana
was American, the flowers were imported from Britain).
